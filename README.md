# food-delivery-regression
Machine learning course project using data from a food delivery company.

This was the final course project for the Machine Learning course. In the project, only certain regression methods from the scikit-learn package were allowed. We were meant to choose two and try them on a dataset that interested us.

The data came from the food delivery company Wolt. https://github.com/woltapp/data-science-summer-intern-2022

I used Lasso and tree regression.
